# markov

Markov Chains AAS. This is a dead-simple API for either building a markov chain
or for retrieving a string generated by one.

## Markov Chain

See the [wiki entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) for an exect
explanation. This program uses a Markov Chain to generate random,
sort-of-but-not-really natural sounding, human readable text. For example, a
Markov Chain seeded with Dante's _Divine Comedy_ might produce some text like
this:

> More than thou thinkest laden are the Heresiarchs, With their disciples of
> all of them,

## Build

    go get -u .
    go build

## Usage

Simply execute the binary, pointing it at a valid redis instance. Once done, the
following endpoints will be exposed:

__/build__

POST'd to in order to add seed data to the chain. This can be called at any
time.

Example:

    cat some-large-text.txt | curl -XPOST -d@- localhost:8080/build

-----

__/generate__

Get'd in order to retrieve randomly generated text from the markov chain. Takes
a mandatory `numParts` GET argument. Parts are sections of text separated by
some punctation (e.g. `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`, `:`, `;`).

Example:

    curl localhost:8080/generate?numParts=2
